Back in London the incident in Mexico has reached the media, M is furious over Bond conducting an unauthorized mission as MI6 is in the middle of a shake up, merging with MI5 and the possibility of cancellation of the 00 program. When Bond seems to be evading questions M grounds him from duty, as he leaves he encounters Max Denbigh/C, the new Director-General of Joint Intelligence Service, a global surveillance network which aims to launch its own spy program \"Nine Eyes\". Bond leaves the building and Moneypenny approaches him with personal effects from Skyfall, Bond asks for them to be brought to his place personally at 9pm. Moneypenny arrives at the requested time, she asks what was he doing in Mexico, he's still evasive, when pressed he plays a recorded message from the previous M before her death, ordering Bond to find and kill Sciarra and attend his funeral. The funeral occurs in three days in Rome, Bond asks Moneypenny to research the name \"The Pale King\" while he goes to Rome quietly. Bond looks through the effects and finds his adoption certificate and a photograph of him with his foster father, another boy is in the photo but his side of the photo has been burned. The next day Tanner takes Bond to Q's lab by the river, he informs Bond on the demolition of the old MI6 building after the bombing from Silva, a sleek glass building across the river was erected as the replacement for the British Intelligence. C is pushing for greater surveillance, purely digitized as he deems human agents obsolete and slow, recent terror attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia are veering government opinion in C's favor and the initiation of the Nine Eyes program will allow preemptive security against global terrorism."
